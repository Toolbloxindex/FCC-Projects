        <h2 class="center" id="about-him"> About him</h2>
        <p class="center"> Steve Jobs, mainly recognized for his work at Apple and Pixar, revolutionized technology and design with visionary innovations like the iPhone, iPad, ipod and mac. Known for his relentless pursuit of perfection, he transformed industries and inspired millions. His legacy continues to shape the future. <br/> <br/>
            Controversial? Yes. Intriguing? Also Yes. Steve jobs wasn't much of an engineer, or a designer even, he just had a <span class="underline">really good taste for what the consumer likes</span>, as Bill Gates once said. As seen in his carrer in Apple and Pixar, he knew what the consumer wanted and managed to revolutionize multiple industries just doing a better version of other products. <br/><br/>
            <em>"A good artist copies. A great artist steals" </em><br/>
            <strong>Steve Jobs</strong>
            <br/> <br/>
            Steve Jobs always said he didn't want to make the most profitable products, he wanted to make great products which he was proud of. This might explain in great lenghts why when he rejoined apple as CEO he set his yearly salary at 1$. 
            <br/><br/>What makes Jobs creations stand out from the highly competitive tech space is the cleanliness, the slim design, the intuite and simple interface, the friendliness of the products, the durable and robust materials, the inovation, by this i mean <span class="underline">minimalism and inovation</span>.
            <br/><br/> All of the above is great and interesting but we must also adress that Steve had quite a temper sometimes. The people that worked with jobs mention his ability to <span class="underline">manipulate people and some may even say, distort reality</span>.
            <br/><br/>At Apple events it's possible to see some of this ability to convice people and bend reality to get us interested in Apple. While this is a great talent it wasn't always put to a good purpose, Steve Jobs always demanded the best of the best from his employees and pushed them really hard to achieve his vision. He was known to be brutally honest to people leaving some emotionally disturbed, many quit because of the highly demanding and stressing eviroment around him.
            <br/><br/> In the Roman empire, when leaders were elected they had to say "memento mori", which is an aknowledgement of death, reminding them they are humans and will end up in a grave someday. Steve Jobs had this moment when he started getting really sick and tired with cancer, making him much more soft and lovable with people. Even when he was dying, <span class="underline">still showed up to the office and continued his relentless work at Apple</span> proving his resilience, this truly shows that Apple was his source of happiness, his mission. 
            <br/><br/>Although he did beat cancer, <span class="underline">he died in 2011 with the secondary effects of a cancer surgery</span>, gone was the distortion of reality and the manipulation of events because <span class="underline">he was human after all</span>, and the only thing we can trully be certain about is our death.
            <br/><br/> Nevertheless Jobs will forever be recognized as an <span class="underline">icon</span> in the big tech space, chaging all of our lives with his remarcable products.
